Ban Checker for PUBG GUI – How to Download & Run

Update: 24th September 2025 21.52pm 

Currently Microsoft Defender is blocking this app saying it's a virus you can still choose to download it but to counter this 
issue i have created a web version here https://grumpelemming.github.io/pubg-ban-checker-web/ so a lot easier to use this
instead

Update 23rd September 20205
Go to the Releases page for latest version
Extract the .zip file to any folder on your computer.
Right-click → Extract All... (Windows built-in).
Note: Ignore the “Source code” downloads – those are for developers. Only grab the .zip
Run the Program
Open the extracted folder.

Double-click ban_checker_gui.exe.
Enter your PUBG player name and platform.
Click Check Ban – results will display in the window.

Windows SmartScreen may warn you since the app isn’t signed with a certificate.
Click More info → Run anyway to proceed.
This happens with most small open-source apps
