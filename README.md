PUBG Ban Checker – User Guide

What it does: Checks if a PUBG player is temporarily or permanently banned.

How to use:

Run ban_checker_gui.exe.

Enter the player name(case sensitive)

Select the platform (steam, xbox, or psn).

Click Check Ban Status.

The result will display below the buttons.

Optionally, click Copy Status to copy it to your clipboard.

Notes:

Requires an internet connection; the EXE communicates with the backend server.

The API key is secured on the backend—your EXE does not contain it.

If the server is down or unreachable, you’ll see an error.

Troubleshooting:

Make sure the player name is spelled correctly(OR GUI RETURNS ERROR 404)

Ensure you’re connected to the internet.

If not working : test user name on pubglookup/op.gg/pubg-meta to see if player may have changed name
